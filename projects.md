# Projects

## Here are the projects that I've done so far in this program

1. Web Page Reconstruction for [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) using Figma. We were tasked to choose a website or an app and recreate its homepage using Figma. I chose YouTube because I watch videos on YouTube a lot of times and I thought it would be fun to recreate the icons in the navigation bar.
